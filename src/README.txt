Divvit's analytics product offers unique insights into each customer's webshop performance, traffic and marketing efficiency. Where other solutions are generic, complex and hard to work with, Divvit offers a 100% ecommerce specific solution with a user friendly UI, curated reports and KPIs. With the data being collected, Divvit will be able to draw valuable conclusions on what are the key drivers behind success and failure within ecommerce and transform this to detailed recommendations for each specific webshop. This is what we refer to as Proactive Ecommerce Analytics.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does Divvit work? =

Divvit uses a JavaScript tracking pixel that will be installed on each page of your shop and track page views, orders and more. We the analyze all this data in the background for you and present it in a nicely organized way.

= What do you mean with Proactive Ecommerce Analytics =

We don’t only present ”dead” numbers but aim to process everything to give the best insights to make it easier to take the correct action. As an example we automatically show you how you are performing this month compared to last, and also show you the projection for the rest of the month. You can also see when the last order was placed through each channels and all the visits a customer has made before placing their order.

= How much does Divvit cost? =

Divvit has both a free version, and a paid version. The free version will always be free, but you will only be able to see the last 7 days of data. If you wish to upgrade, you can do so for a fee. Please have a look at https://www.divvit.com/pricing to see what category you fit in.
